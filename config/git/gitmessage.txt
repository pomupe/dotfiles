# ------ Commit Message Guidlines ------
# Each commit message consists type, subject and body:
# <type>: <subject>
# <BLANK LINE>
# <body>
#
#
# ------ Type ------
# Must be one of the following:
# build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
# ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
# docs: Documentation only changes
# feat: A new feature
# fix: A bug fix
# perf: A code change that improves performance
# refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
# test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
#
#
# ------ Subject ------
# The subject contains a succinct description of the change:
# - use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
# - don't capitalize the first letter
# - no dot (.) at the end
